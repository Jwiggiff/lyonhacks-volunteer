<h1>About The Team</h1>
<p>
  We are a group of grade 12 students in Toronto who ran into this idea during a
  hackathon. Volunteering is incredibly beneficial to everyone, whether it be
  high school students trying to get involved in the community or an adult
  wanting to give back. However, we noticed that there really isn’t a single
  go-to place to find opportunities, and to post them. And that’s how :Insert
  name here: was born.
