  <h1>About The Team</h1>
  <hr />
  <p>
    We are a group of grade 12 students in Toronto who ran into this idea during
    a hackathon. Volunteering is incredibly beneficial to everyone, whether it
    be a high school student trying to get involved in the community or an adult
    wanting to give back. However, we noticed that there really isn’t a single
    go-to place to find opportunities, and to post them. And that’s how
    Volunteerism was born.
