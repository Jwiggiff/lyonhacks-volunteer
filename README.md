# Volunteerism

We are a group of grade 12 students in Toronto who ran into this idea during a hackathon. Whether you are a high school student trying to get involved in your community or an adult wanting to give back, volunteering is incredibly beneficial to everyone. However, we noticed that there really isn’t a single go-to place to find opportunities, and to post them. And that’s how Volunteerism was born.

Volunteerism is a website that will recommend volunteer opportunities based on your interests and past volunteer positions you've had. Organizations and schools can also create accounts to post their opportunities and recruit volunteers.
